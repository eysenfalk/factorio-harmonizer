The user wants to take a more systematic approach to building the Factorio Mod Harmonizer. They want to:

1. Modularize everything so each part can be tested independently
2. They'll do the work and testing while I guide them through it

This is a much better approach than trying to debug a large monolithic script. Let me break down the system into logical modules and guide them through building and testing each one step by step.

Based on the original design, here are the key modules we should create:

1. **mod_info.py** - Handle mod discovery and info.json parsing
2. **lua_environment.py** - Set up and manage the Lua execution environment
3. **modification_tracker.py** - Track changes to data.raw
4. **data_models.py** - Define the data structures for prototypes and history
5. **dependency_analyzer.py** - Analyze dependencies and find incompatibilities
6. **mod_loader.py** - Main orchestrator that ties everything together

Let's start with the simplest module first and work our way up.

Excellent approach! Let's break this down into testable modules. This will make debugging much easier and ensure each component works before we integrate them.

Here's the modular structure I recommend:

## Module Breakdown

1. **`mod_info.py`** - Mod discovery and info.json parsing
2. **`lua_environment.py`** - Lua runtime setup and basic execution
3. **`modification_tracker.py`** - Track changes to data.raw
4. **`data_models.py`** - Data structures for prototypes and history
5. **`dependency_analyzer.py`** - Analyze dependencies and find issues
6. **`mod_loader.py`** - Main orchestrator

Let's start with the **simplest and most fundamental module first**.

## Step 1: Create `mod_info.py`

This module will handle:
- Scanning directories for mods
- Parsing `info.json` files
- Basic dependency parsing

Create a new file `mod_info.py` with this structure:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Mod Information Parser
Handles discovery and parsing of Factorio mod information
"""

import json
import zipfile
from pathlib import Path
from typing import List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass, field

@dataclass
class ModInfo:
    """Parsed mod information from info.json"""
    name: str
    version: str
    title: str
    author: str
    dependencies: List[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    path: Path = None
    is_zipped: bool = False

class ModDiscovery:
    """Discovers and parses mod information"""
    
    def __init__(self, mods_path: Path):
        self.mods_path = Path(mods_path)
    
    def discover_mods(self) -> List[ModInfo]:
        """Discover all mods in the directory"""
        # TODO: Implement this
        pass
    
    def _parse_mod_info(self, info_file: Path, mod_path: Path, is_zipped: bool) -> Optional[ModInfo]:
        """Parse mod info.json file"""
        # TODO: Implement this
        pass

# Test function
def test_mod_discovery():
    """Test the mod discovery functionality"""
    # TODO: Create test mods and test discovery
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_mod_discovery()
```

**Your task**: 
1. Create this file
2. Implement the `discover_mods()` method to scan for both zipped and unzipped mods
3. Implement the `_parse_mod_info()` method to parse info.json files
4. Create a simple test that creates a test mod and verifies it can be discovered

Once you have this working and can successfully discover the test mod we created earlier, let me know and we'll move to the next module!

**Testing goal**: The script should output something like:
```
Found 1 mod(s):
- test-mod v1.0.0 (Test Mod) by Test Author
  Dependencies: ['base']
  Path: test_mods/test-mod
```

Start with this module and let me know when you have it working or if you run into any issues!
